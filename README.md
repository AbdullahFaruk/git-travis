Git Travis-CI integration
-------------------------

Simple git subcommand to display the current build status for the project you are in.

Install
-------

    npm -g install git-travis


Usage
-----

Change into a git repo that has builds on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Then issue: `git travis` to display the latest build.

Notes
-----

This was a simple script because I liked it, I'll add some configuration to it in the future.
